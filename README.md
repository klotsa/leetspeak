# _Leet Speak BDD_

#### _Leat Speak 2017_

#### By _**Anatoliy Klots, Zach Beecher**_

## Description

_Leet Speak with Leetspeak uses an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words. For example, "leet" becomes "1337" and "Epicodus" might become "3p1c0duz".
Write a Ruby method on the String class that converts a string using some of the rules of Leetspeak:
The letter "e" should be replaced with "3".
The letter "o" should be replaced with "0".
The capital letter "I" (but not the lower case, "i") should be replaced with "1".
All instances of "s" should be replaced with "z" UNLESS it is the first letter of the word.
Here is a sample of input and output
In: "Don't you love these 'String' exercises? I do!"
Out: "D0n't y0u l0ve theze 'String' exercizez? 1 d0!"_
